# Data Confidence

### Project Alvarium

Project Alvarium creates the first Data Confidence Fabric capable of measuring data trust. The project was initially incubated within Dell Technologies with contributions from the IOTA Foundation. It was announced as an emerging Linux Foundation project in November 2019 and is part of the [LF Edge](https://wiki.lfedge.org/) working group. [Dell, IOTA and Intel continued to evolve the concept](https://blog.iota.org/together-iota-and-dell-technologies-demonstrate-project-alvarium/) behind the scenes.
